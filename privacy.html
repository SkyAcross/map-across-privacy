  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This privacy policy applies to the Map Across app (hereafter referred to as "the Application") for mobile devices, created by Yue Liu ("the Service Provider") as a commercial service. The Application is provided "as is."</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>The Application does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or anonymous user data. The Service Provider does not operate a backend server, and no usage analytics are collected.</p>


  <h2>Location Information</h2>

  <p>The Application may request access to your device’s location in order to provide features such as finding nearby places. However, this location data is processed locally on your device and is <strong>not collected, stored, or transmitted</strong> by the Service Provider.</p>

  <h2>Contact Information</h2>

  <p>If you contact the Service Provider by email (e.g., <a href="mailto:skyacrossapp@gmail.com">skyacrossapp@gmail.com</a>), your message and contact information may be retained in order to respond to your inquiry. This data is not shared or used for any other purpose.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>

  <p>No personal data is collected, and therefore no personal data is retained. If you contact the Service Provider and request that your email or inquiry be deleted, you can reach out to <a href="mailto:skyacrossapp@gmail.com">skyacrossapp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>The Application is not directed to children under the age of 13, and the Service Provider does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact <a href="mailto:skyacrossapp@gmail.com">skyacrossapp@gmail.com</a> so that it can be deleted.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>

  <p>The Service Provider is committed to safeguarding your data. While no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, appropriate security measures are in place to protect the data handled by the Application.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>

  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page, and your continued use of the Application after updates constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-06-04</p>

  <h2>Your Consent</h2>

  <p>By using the Application, you consent to the terms described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact the Service Provider at:</p>
